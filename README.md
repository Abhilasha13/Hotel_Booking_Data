# Hotel_Booking_Data
This project aims at performing data analysis and visualization on Hotel Booking dataset.

## INTRODUCTION: PROJECT GOALS
In this project we analyzed the Hotel booking demand dataset from Kaggle to perform data analysis and predictive modeling. In tourism and travel related industries like hospitality the research on revenue management, demand forecasting and prediction problems cannot be fully explored without industry specific data. Hence, we decided to use the hotel booking data to overcome these challenges and perform valuable analysis.

We used the data to perform research in different problems areas such as bookings cancellation trends, market segmentation, booking trends, seasonality etc. We also performed predictive modeling to benchmark bookings’ prediction cancellation models against results already known.

The project has the following stages:
•	Data cleaning and preprocessing
•	Data analysis using visualizations
•	Predictive Modelling

The final goal of the project is to analyze is to solve the business problems mentioned below and to build a model that can predict hotel booking cancelations accurately.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The project aims to provide answers to the following business problems related to hotel bookings:
•	How to increase revenue generated by hotels using existing booking data.
•	How to manage booking influx during peak season using prioritization.
•	How to predict if bookings received by the hotel will be cancelled to make informed business decisions.

Solving these business problems will help in increasing the revenue generated through bookings and also help in efficiently managing the bookings during peak seasons by prioritizing high value bookings that have lower chances of cancelation. In addition, predicting booking cancelations allows us to accurately predict net demand and build better forecasts, improve cancellation policies, define better overbooking tactics and thus use more assertive pricing and inventory allocation strategies.

## DATASET DESCRIPTION
The Hotel Booking Demand dataset has been taken from Kaggle. This dataset contains a single file and it consists of the booking information related to two hotels: City hotel and Resort hotel. The dataset includes 119390 records and 32 attributes.

## DATA CLEANING AND PREPROCESSING:
Real world data tend to be incomplete and inconsistent. Our dataset had some issues which were fixed by preprocessing activities. The data preprocessing was performed using Pandas and R Studio and the different steps that we followed during this process are explained below:

**1. Removing columns with more than 90% null values**
A few columns in the dataset contained null values which were removed in order to improve the quality of data. Columns company, agent and country were removed in this process.

![Columns With Above 90% Null Values](https://github.com/Abhilasha13/Hotel_Booking_Data/blob/main/images/columns_with_above_90_percent_null.png)


**2. Removing outliers wherever necessary**
Some of the columns in the given dataset had outliers which may lead to unnecessary complication in data analysis and might cause overfitting and skewness of result, so we had removed outliers from the dataset wherever it was necessary.

**3. Finding correlation between the continuous and dependent variable**
In order to find out how the entire feature set is related to the cancellation status; we have used the Pearson’s Correlation. This step helped us to select features that are useful for our prediction model. As a result of the Pearson’s plot it was observed that the continuous variables like booking_changes, previous_cancellation, lead_time, total_of_special_requests and required_car_parking_spaces had a good correlation.

## PROPOSED METHODOLOGY 
### Data Visualization 
For understanding and deriving insights from our dataset we propose to use Tableau. We have created 2 different dashboards using this method that helps in understanding our problem are and solution that we recommend.

### Data Analysis
For analyzing the data further and solving the problem of predicting the booking cancellation, we have used R and developed a predictive model that will be helpful for both the hotels to predict the future booking cancellation.

## Data Visualization

### Dashboard 1: Revenue Generation
![Revenue Generation](https://github.com/Abhilasha13/Hotel_Booking_Data/blob/main/images/revenue_generation.png)

As mentioned, the best practices of visualization was leveraged to understand our dataset and discover key insights that helped us in solution recommendation for the problems that we have focused. Below are the two dashboards that we created using Tableau. 

Dashboard one showcases trend of ‘is Repeated guest’ across different month. Along with it, the cancellation behavior of different market segment for 2 hotels across ‘City Hotel’ and ‘Resort Hotel’  for top 6 countries having maximum cancellations. Insights from this dashboard helps hotel management to manage its revenue generation by understanding cancellation of different market segments and accordingly give preference to bookings. 

### Dashboard 2: Booking’s Influx management using Agent Prioritization
![Booking’s Influx management using Agent Prioritization](https://github.com/Abhilasha13/Hotel_Booking_Data/blob/main/images/booking_influx_management.png)

Dashboard two with its key insights helps in solving the challenge of managing the booking influx of the two hotels.  Firstly, it focuses on analyzing behavior of booking made directly i.e. booking not made by any agent. Secondly, it then focuses on trend of bookings made via agents and observe the behavior of bookings by considering number of cancellations, repeated guests and previous bookings. Key findings from this dashboard will help hotels to give priority to booking that are made by specific agents having good records and manage the booking influx. In the dashboard shown below that the Agent number 240 has the lowest number of booking cancelations and highest number of bookings from guests who revisit the hotel. It helps in identifying the agents that generate a significant amount of revenue for the hotel and also gives us a reason to give them priority over bookings done by other agents.

## Why Prediction Modelling?
During the analysis one important insight was found that the maximum revenue loss is incurred when the cancelations happen within one week from arrival. In such scenarios it would be helpful if we predict the cancelations well in advance and take measures to mitigate revenue losses.

## Predictive Modelling
C5.0 Decision tree algorithm was used to predict the hotel booking cancelations. This algorithm was used because of the following reasons:
1) Best Accuracy
2) Least computational time
3) Maximum Sensitivity

80% of the data is used to build a training set and the rest 20% is the testing set. The steps followed for predictive modeling are explained below:
1.	Divide the dataset into training and test datasets. The training dataset is used to train the model for predictions and then the accuracy of predictions is measured using test dataset.
2.	Run C5.0 Decision tree algorithm using all attributes to train our prediction model for predicting booking cancelations.
3.	Run the algorithm on test data to see the accuracy of prediction.
4.	Run C5.0 algorithm using the top 10 variables and not all, to train the model.
5.	Run the algorithm again on test data to see if the accuracy of prediction has increased.

## RESULTS OF PREDICTIVE MODELING
The accuracy that is achieved using top 10 attributes was approx. 84% and with using all the attributes it reduced to 83%. Therefore, it is recommended using the most important attributes for predictions and not all of them as it gives higher accuracy.

## PRECISION AND RECALL
The value of precision is 0.82 and for recall it is 0.70, the value of precision and recall is calculated using the formula:

![Precision and Recall Formula](https://github.com/Abhilasha13/Hotel_Booking_Data/blob/main/images/Precision_Recall.png)

Precision tells us what percentage of the total predicted cancelations were actually canceled bookings. High value of precision means that most of the actual cancelations were predicted by us accurately. On the other hand, recall tells us how many of the actual cancelations our model predicted by labeling them positive. In our case there is high cost associated with false positive, so higher precision is more important. High precision will ensure that all the booking that we predict as canceled are actually canceled.

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS
For our business problems, we recommend:
1.	Highest cancellations market segment ‘Groups’ pay mandatory deposit amount. This will help hotel management to overcome the loss of booking cancellations and continue to generate revenue. 
2.	Give Priority to specific online agents having high non-cancellations past record during peak booking months. This will help managing the booking influx during peak seasons.
3.	Help hotel management to predict whether new booking would be canceled or not and approve incoming booking accordingly.
